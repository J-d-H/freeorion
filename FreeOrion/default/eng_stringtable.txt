FREEORION_VISION
FreeOrion, an open-source game based on Master of Orion, is a turn-based game of epic space strategy that builds on the classic '4X' model by incorporating the nation-building elements of games such as Europa Universalis 2 and a versatile tactical combat engine. While its modular, open-source design allows for a significant degree of customization of the game engine and the story elements by the community, the FreeOrion team is dedicated to the construction of a living, breathing universe in a 'grand campaign' model.

PEACE_TITLE
Peace
PEACE_TEXT
Peace is the diplomatic state between empires in which they mutually agree not to attack each other's ships or planets, not to obstruct each other's [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] lines, and not to impede colonization.

OUTPOSTS_TITLE
Outposts
OUTPOSTS_TEXT
'''Outposts are unmanned stations, which can be founded in places too hostile for a colony to survive. They have no population, and normally produce no resources. But they create [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] (with the right tech) and provide vision. Colonies can be founded on planets that already have an Outpost. To build an Outpost, you need to put an [[shippart CO_OUTPOST_POD]] on a ship. Outposts are also formed when the population of a colony drops to zero for any reason.'''

GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE
Growth Focus
GROWTH_FOCUS_TEXT
'''The Growth Focus represents exporting rare materials and substances that aid the population growth of a certain species. Is only available in certain situations: on some homeworlds, and on planets with growth specials.  A planet focused on Growth increases the max Population only of other planets connected to it by [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] lines.  A Homeworld focused on Growth only helps other planets of the same species.  Growth Special planets focused on growth, only help a single classification of species, for instance some only help Organic Species.'''

MINING_FOCUS_TITLE
Mining Focus
MINING_FOCUS_TEXT
'''The Mining Focus is only available on planets with certain rare specials.  Focusing on Mining provides a significant production bonus.'''

TRADE_FOCUS_TITLE
Trade Focus
TRADE_FOCUS_TEXT
'''Trade doesn't do anything, yet.  It is just a placeholder to show that more resources are planned.'''

PROTECTION_FOCUS_TITLE
Protection Focus
PROTECTION_FOCUS_TEXT
'''The Protection focus represents a planet wholly focused on defending itself.  [[encyclopedia TROOP_TITLE]], Planetary [[encyclopedia DEFENSE_TITLE]], and Planetary [[encyclopedia SHIELDS_TITLE]] are all increased.'''

INDUSTRY_TITLE
Industry
INDUSTRY_TEXT
'''Industry represents the production and modification of physical goods. It is needed to produce buildings, space ships and other projects.

The Industry of a planet can be used for any production projects of [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] line connected planets. Any un-allocated Industry is lost each turn.'''

RESEARCH_TITLE
Research
RESEARCH_TEXT
'''The Research of all planets in the empire is combined to research new technologies. Any un-allocated Research is lost each turn.

Research does not require [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] line connections to be used.'''

HAPPINESS_TITLE
Happiness
HAPPINESS_TEXT
'''Happiness doesn't do anything yet.'''

INFRASTRUCTURE_TITLE
Infrastructure
INFRASTRUCTURE_TEXT
'''The term Infrastructure refers to technical structures that support a colonized planet: energy, transportation, telecommunication and social services for the citizens.'''

DEFENSE_TITLE
Defense
DEFENSE_TEXT
'''The Defense meter of a planet represents the power of the ground to space weapons installed. It's comparable to the Damage value of a space ship.'''

SHIELDS_TITLE
Shields
SHIELDS_TEXT
'''The term Shields combines all kinds of protective forcefields. Regenerating each turn, they are usually the first barrier incoming attacks have to overcome.

Space ships and planets have a Shields meter.'''

STEALTH_TITLE
Stealth
STEALTH_TEXT
'''The term Stealth represents the ability of an object to dodge all kinds of sensors. Only empires with a [[encyclopedia DETECTION_TITLE]] value higher than or equal to the Stealth value can see the object.

Space ships, buildings, specials, systems and planets have a Stealth meter.'''

DETECTION_TITLE
Detection Strength
DETECTION_TEXT
'''The term Detection Strength represents the technological level of an empire's sensors. An empire can only see objects that have a [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] value lower than or equal to its Detection Strength value and are within [[encyclopedia DETECTION_RANGE_TITLE]] of a controlled space ship or planet.

Empires have a Detection Strength meter.'''

DETECTION_RANGE_TITLE
Detection Range
DETECTION_RANGE_TEXT
'''The Detection Range represents the number of uus sensors can reach. An empire can only see objects that have a [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] value lower than or equal to its [[encyclopedia DETECTION_TITLE]] value and are within Detection Range of a controlled space ship or planet.

Space ships and planets have a Detection Range meter. There is the option to display Detection Range circles in the Galaxy Map section of the Options menu.'''

TROOP_TITLE
Troops
TROOP_TEXT
'''The term Troops combines all kinds of military forces capable of operating on a planets surface.

The Troop meter on a planet represents the power of the defending ground forces.  The invading force must send a more powerful force (i.e. a higher cumulative number) to conquer a planet.'''

ORGANIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Organic Metabolism
ORGANIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Organic species are more or less, 'life as we know it'.  These species max population can be increased when their connected homeworld is set on [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]], or when when an Organic Growth Special is colonized, and focused on Growth.  Organic Growth specials are marked with a little green 'O' in the corner.'''

LITHIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Lithic Metabolism
LITHIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Lithic species are silicon or mineral-based.  These species max population can be increased when their connected homeworld is set on [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]], or when when a Lithic Growth Special is colonized, and focused on Growth.  Lithic Growth specials are marked with a little grey 'L' in the corner.'''

ROBOTIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Robotic Metabolism
ROBOTIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Robotic species are sapient machines.  These species max population can be increased when their connected homeworld is set on [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]], or when when an Robotic Growth Special is colonized, and focused on Growth.  Robotic Growth specials are marked with a little red 'R' in the corner.'''

PHOTOTROPHIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Phototrophic Metabolism
PHOTOTROPHIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Phototrophic species live mainly or entirely on sunlight. These species max population is greatly influenced by the brightness of the local star -- the bigger the better.  Growth specials do not benefit them.'''

SELF_SUSTAINING_SPECIES_TITLE
Self-Sustaining Metabolism
SELF_SUSTAINING_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Self-Sustaining species may be energy or crystalline beings or something even stranger.  Their commonality is that they need no sustenance, so their max population is very high. While there are no specials that boost their growth, their max population is equal to a species that is provided with all three growth specials.'''

TELEPATHIC_TITLE
Telepathy
TELEPATHY_TEXT
'''Telepathic species are immune to mind-control and make it easier to research [[tech LRN_PSIONICS]].'''

FUEL_TITLE
Fuel
FUEL_TEXT
'''Fuel allows ships to travel the star-lanes. When entering a star-lane a ship consumes 1 unit of fuel.  Fuel is not used up at any other time.  [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] lines will fully refuel a ship.  If a ship travels beyond friendly supply lines, fuel will slowly regenerate when the ship is outside of the star-lanes.'''

SUPPLY_TITLE
Supply
SUPPLY_TEXT
'''Supply lines are shown by coloring star-lanes with an empire's color. Planets connected by supply lines can share physical resources -- production created on one planet, can be used on any connected planet to build ships or structures.  Supply lines can also be used to refill the [[encyclopedia FUEL_TITLE]] supply of ships.

The supply meter on a planet represents the number of star-lanes supply can reach.'''


FLEET_UPKEEP_TITLE
Fleet Upkeep
FLEET_UPKEEP_TEXT
'''The cost of a fleet is more than the sum of the cost of its ships due to the oporational costs associated with managing multiple ships. When producing new ships, hull costs increase by 5% for each ship already owned by the empire.'''

EVACUATION_TITLE
Evacuation
EVACUATION_TEXT
'''The [[buildingtype BLD_EVACUATION]] project when built will remove the population of a planet. Each turn some of the population will be removed. If there are planets colonized by the same species with free space, and connected by [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] lines, one will be randomly chosen and the population will move there. If there are no appropriate planets available, the population disapears into the vastness of space.
During an evacuation production drops to nothing. When the colony is empty, it reverts to an [[encyclopedia OUTPOSTS_TITLE]]. It still belongs to the same empire, and may be re-colonized once the [[buildingtype BLD_EVACUATION]] deletes itself.'''

[[BAD_GROUND_TROOPS]]
[[BAD_POPULATION]]

Biology:
Adult Fifty-Seven are between 10 and 20 m long. The main deviation from the tapering serpentine body are the two resonating domes on the forward dorsal side. Various fins provide fine control. Entirely blind, they rely on smell, hearing, an exquisitely honed pressure sensitivity, and when the need arises bursts of echolocation. Fifty-Seven are omnivores: eating flocks of small flying creatures with the same relish as the floating phytoplankton. Since they remain aloft their entire lives and have no manipulator limbs, the Fifty-Seven have no material technology.

Personality:
The Fifty-Seven show little interest in the rest of the galaxy, or indeed in the parts of their planet that they don't use. The bulk of their attention individually, and culturally is focused on math. They do seem eager for new mathematical puzzles, so if research problems can be phrased properly...

Homeworld:
High g swamp world with a very dense atmosphere.

Reason for Staying:
The Fifty-Seven are in constant contact with most of the rest of their species, participating in a complex fractal 'song' that may also be a way to test complex mathematical hypotheses and/or some sort of social or artistic expression. Leaving the fractal song is apparently extremely unattractive.

[[ULTIMATE_GROUND_TROOPS]]

The Raaagh are 1.5 meter tall stripe-furred bipeds.  The body is held leaning forward at 45 degrees, leaving the fanged jaws, and clawed arms free to fight, build or capture prey. Triangular ears and slit pupils give a cat-like appearance.  The tiny young hatch from a clutch of a dozen eggs at once. Little care or attention is paid to the young at this stage-- they must survive on their own competing against their siblings for hiding places and stealing food like vermin.  After three years usually only one is left, and the surviving young begin to learn to speak.  This suddenly activates parental instincts, and the survivor is carefully raised as a member of the Pride.

Personality:
Extreme territoriality is the Raaagh's most distinctive trait- woven throughout their daily lives and culture.  Related to that is a preference for the familiar and known. Curiosity is minimal, which probably explains their stone age technology.

Homeworld:
The Raaagh homeworld is of the Terran type.  Sea and land are more or less evenly spread out, with the largest continent coverly only 4% of planet's surface.  The many small continents and large islands encourage a territorial attitude.

Reason for Staying:
There's not bit of land big enough for an individual Raaagh to live on that hasn't been fought over for centuries.  The genetic compulsion of a Raaagh is to guard his territory with his life, and when possible to expand into adjacent land.  Abandoning one's territory is inconcievable, and a Raaagh forcibly removed from his territory goes violently insane.

The entire planet is covered in a beige haze of Nanites. It is unknown wheather they were dropped as a weapon, were an out of control experiment, or are a means of extracting resources, but they have been thorough. There's nothing left but the planet's radioactive core.  These Nanites are very efficient assemblers, and are eager to do so if provided raw materials.  However the Nanites, are extremely protective of the secret of their design-- they self destruct if any are captured or removed from the planet.

The expanse itself seems to be immortal, and non-reproducing. Attempts to clone part of it have failed, so it seems the Gis will be unable to leave their world.

[[NO_GROUND_TROOPS]]

The Hidden Gardener is a massive distributed fungal intelligence lying just beneath the surface. Each individual covers many square kilometers. Its actions and thoughts are slow. Various sensory nodes are scattered about by which it can monitor the weather and the growth of its garden. A Hidden Gardener, by means of enzymes, the encapsulation and releases of seeds, and the control of water, tends its garden to produce precisely the rotting plant matter it needs to survive.

Fungal-type life-forms seldom have much use for brains of any type, but the Gardener's unusual, and thoughtful approach to providing itself with food provides enough additional energy to make it work.

Their terran homeworld is an eerily park-like place with plants arranged with unnatural precision, but no other signs of habitation.

The wide ranging, delicate fungi-nets are too large and integrated into the soil to be moved off-planet, and since the Hidden Gardeners reproduce by 'splitting' into two consciousnesses when a Gardener grows too wide-ranging to have a decent thought-latency, there are no small, young individuals to take off planet.'''

[[encyclopedia SELF_SUSTAINING_SPECIES_TITLE]]

[[GREAT_INDUSTRY]]
[[GOOD_RESEARCH]]

Description
An Acirem is a 10-30 m ellipsoidal energy beings with large (30-100m) ''wings''. As they age they tend to accumulate material from around them developing a dusty and eventually rocky appearance (still maintaining the visible energy flows through their body and the gaps). Most Acirema live in a universe where the physical constants are slightly different, and there is only one place where they can get through to our universe, on their "Homeworld" of Portal. However, upon doing that they immediately begin to 'age' differently than in their own universe. Acirema cannot survive more than a few fractions of a galactic cycle in this universe. So an Acirem rarely spends much time before crossing back into their own universe.

As the Acirema found the anomaly that allowed them to enter into this universe, they also found that harnessing the differences in structure allowed them to generate energy in massive amounts in both universes. They also found that their bodies could release and manipulate massive amounts of energy. They rapidly began gathering material on Portal to study, and use to build structures on Portal itself. However that massive amount of energy meant they rapidly mined Portal out, and soon had very limited minerals that were safe for them to extract.

The massive amount of energy they can release as individuals and across the connection from Portal to their home universe, gives them the ability to produce large amounts of Industry, and also allows them to act as weapons. This makes Portal a very dangerous world to approach, as the Acirema are very wary of outsiders, and are sensitive to the vulnerability of their position. Trade with another universe is definitely beneficial, especially since they cannot obtain minerals from other planets. The Acirema on Portal seem to have a government that is similar to a military and/or research outpost (tightly controlled core with a majority loosely controlled) They are very secretive of the nature of their society back home.

"Homeworld"
Portal is a Radiated world close to an unusually bright Blue Giant Star, with a connection to another universe. It is thought that Precursor testing may have opened the connection, and caused the star to change. There is suspicion that there may have been intelligent life on Portal, and they were destroyed by the Acirema when the connection opened (either due to research or advanced weapons use).

Reason for staying
They can't stay here long enough to actually move to another planet and still survive.'''

[[encyclopedia ORGANIC_SPECIES_TITLE]]

[[AVERAGE_RESEARCH]]


Biology:
A giant serpentine swimmer, an Ourbools most distinctive feature is the massive bow curving away on either side of their head.  This houses the gravi-sensory organs.  Three tentacles hanging in front of the mouth allow Ourbools to manipulate their environment.  Ourbools mate only once in their life, and devote the next 35 years to caring for the school of 5 to 7 young -- generally assisted by relatives.  Ourbools live long so

Personality:
Ourbools are inclined to a nomadic life, hunting or herding their prey ichtioids.  Society focuses to a large degree on the proper and graceful interaction between two wandering groups that meet by chance.
A significant minority drop out of society and adopt sedentary lives bound by the practical requirements of their craft

Homeworld:
The homeworld, Oolur is orbited by 23 moons.

Reason for Staying:
The Ourbools find their sense of position via the regular movements of the 23 moons.  Everything is perceived against that gravitational background.  To be removed from that context is extremely disorienting to the point of "blinding" the unlucky traveler.  He no longer has the familiar to calibrate against so all he can perceive is meaningless graviton noise.

[[GOOD_POPULATION]]

Description:
The Volp-Uglush are an asexual species approximately 300 meters in length that live in tunnels on their homeworld. They subsist on silicates and have a vast number of short arm/mouth parts on the front of their thick cylindrical bodies that they use for manipulation/tunnelling/eating and for sending messages through their tunnel network. In early historical times there were several different strains of Volp-Uglush but they were in constant conflict. Groups that successfully organized themselves were the best competers for resources, and as they moved from industrial to information age, one strain became dominant, and the remainder died out. The remaining strain began to optimize their homeworld for most efficient use of resources. They became incredibly adept at recognizing resouce needs, as well as how societal structures affected individual behavior.
The Volp-Uglush society almost acts as a single organism, because society has been adapted to run so smoothly. However, this has led to a critical loss of independent function. While Volp-Uglush society is incredibly efficient, it would take individual Volp-Uglushs hundreds, if not thousands of years to be able to successfully develop a new independent society.
They are very effective at directing merchant fleets, and make excellent bureaucrats for creating changes in societies. While they have an incredibly efficient war machine, and are capable of indivudually taking on various large battle engines, the chaos of combat is not their most effective environment.

Home World:
Hive is a large Barren world that is ~2 times bigger than its mass and material would suggest as all of it but a small metal core has been converted through tunneling and building into the Vast tunnel network of the Volp-Uglush bureaucracy.

Reason for Staying:
Volp-Uglush are now to integrated and ingrown. They now totally lack the independance and innovation needed to leave Hive and start a new colony.

Atop each neck, is a compound eye, and a mouth used for ingestion and for manipulating objects.  This allows the creature too keep watch in most directions at once.  The actual brain is in the center of the body.

Name:
The Furthest believe that sapience is measured by the distance that a being can separate itself from danger. Thus the name " Furthest" describes their species as the most advanced of beings.

Personality: 
The Furthest report that their homeworld was once full of the deadliest predators imaginable.  They survived by developing caution to the utmost level.  Indeed staying alert for threats, and hiding  are the core of their psychology and culture. The Furthest homeworld currently contains no carnivore they can't crush underfoot.

Reason for Staying:
The Furthest generally consider space travel far too dangerous for a sane being, but some who consider their homeworld too dangerous may consider relocating to another world.

THEORY_SHORT_DESC
Theoretical Prerequisite

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN
The Physical Brain

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN_DESC
The structures and their functions in the brain are determined. The electrochemical and quantum nature of thought and memory are exposed. With understanding, alteration and augmentation of brain functions becomes possible, and new ideas are spawned at the frontiers of thought, its expression, and its replacement.

LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE
Algorithmic Elegance

LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE_DESC
'''Increases Target [[encyclopedia RESEARCH_TITLE]] on all Research focused planets by 0.25 per Population.

With greater and greater difficulty of data analysis problems, traditional measures of algorithm performance become less useful due to the limitations of irreducible complexity. At this stage, other measures of algorithm form and function become significant; aesthetically and metaphorically, the elegance of the solution must be optimized.'''

LRN_TRANSLING_THT
Translinguistics

LRN_TRANSLING_THT_DESC
'''Does nothing. Later this can enable peaceful acquistion of native planets.

Lesser minds struggle with, or accept the confines of the language they have learned. Adequate minds reach and feel constrained by the concepts they are given ways to express. Truly great minds break free of the bounds of language, forming and analyzing thoughts that verge on the transcendental. But merely great minds are left isolated and futile, for without language to express thoughts, how can they share their insights?'''

LRN_PSIONICS
Psionics

LRN_PSIONICS_DESC
'''[[encyclopedia RESEARCH_TITLE]] Cost is greatly reduced when the empire includes a telepathic species.

Through deep introspection or artificial enhancement, the brain may develop abilities to directly interact with the universe around it, bypassing the limitations of a physical body. Powers such as telepathy, empathy, clairvoyance, prescience, psychokinesis and psychoenergetics replace or surpass mundane biological or technological alternatives. Applications of these powers, including mind control, personality alteration and possession have profound implications for the relationship between talented and untalented beings.'''

LRN_ARTIF_MINDS
Nacent Artificial Intelligence

LRN_ARTIF_MINDS_DESC
'''Increases Target [[encyclopedia RESEARCH_TITLE]] on all planets by the greater of 0.5 per [[POP_PER_PRODUCTION]] units of Population, or 0.25 per [[INFRA_PER_PRODUCTION]] units of [[encyclopedia INFRASTRUCTURE_TITLE]].

While traditional computers have nearly unfathomable intelligence and computational abilities, they lack the essential qualities of self-awareness, consciousness or sentience. While these traits remain elusive, reasonable faximilies may be produced. These investigations open new avenues of research into cognitive sciences and novel metaparadigms.

Nacent AIs can input all data discovered by active researchers into a single automatic data processing network, data can be analyzed and new data obtained by an entirely automated research facility. Each planet can contain such structures regardless of the population's occupations, giving a bonus to research on all worlds.'''

LRN_XENOARCH
Xenoarchaeology

XENOARCH_SHORT_DESC
Allows discoveries from Ruins

LRN_XENOARCH_DESC
'''Allows discoveries from [[special ANCIENT_RUINS_SPECIAL]].

The contemporary empires, races and single-star civilizations are not the first or only beings to have lived in this galaxy. Remains, ruins and rumours of the ancients may be found on deserted planets and lifeless asteroids, or drifting in open space. Finding and deciphering such clues holds great potential to reveal secrets, teach lessons, or give warnings of ancient knowledge.

It is often exceedingly difficult and dangerous to decipher the clues left by ancient civilizations in the form of highly advanced technology. Mistreatment of the technology or accidental activation can cause the technology itself and/or the archaeologists extracting the technology to be lost. By containing the technology safely within a force field and probing its depths via non-local field manipulation, it is possible to safely recover and unlock the mysteries of ancient technology.'''

LRN_GRAVITONICS
Gravitonics

LRN_GRAVITONICS_DESC
Analogous to the "color charge" of quantum chromodynamics, there are several types of graviton. With the common attractive-force graviton, the colloquial "anti-graviton", "right-graviton" and "left-graviton" may be combined to bend and flex the surface of space-time arbitrarily. This manipulation is perceived as control of the force of gravity, permitting structures, craft and investigations previously impossible, even theoretically.

LRN_EVERYTHING
Theory of Everything

LRN_EVERYTHING_DESC
Early, naive theories describe subsets of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. A complete framework expressing all forces as special cases of a single interaction represents a holy grail of science. This theory describes the earliest moments of the universe, the most distorted depths of a singularity, the tightest windings of hidden dimensions and the final fate of the cosmos. Yet still, there may "exist" layers of existence beyond what can be observed and described by science...

LRN_FORCE_FIELD
Force-Field Harmonics

LRN_FORCE_FIELD_DESC
'''Increases max [[encyclopedia SHIELDS_TITLE]] on all planets by 10.

Like Fourier analysis of sound, electromagnetism, strong and weak forces may be expressed as harmonic quantum standing-wave superpositions of force-carrier particles. By selectively amplifying these harmonics, forces may be arbitrarily controlled to shield, attack, contain or support.'''

LRN_MIND_VOID
Mind of the Void

LRN_MIND_VOID_DESC
We are not alone in the cosmos... but why should the search be so limited? Many cultures have myths, legends or fervent belief in a higher consciousness. Whether a loving or malevolent God, or a detached observer, it is clear that something, perhaps the universe itself on some level, is alive, aware, watching.

LRN_TIME_MECH
Temporal Mechanics

LRN_TIME_MECH_DESC
What are "now", "future" and "past"? The twin paradox of special relativity, or the theoretical "wormhole" in its place, suggest early forms of "time travel". Direct manipulation of spacetime and temporal flux permit these effects to be harnessed and magnified. Temporal incursions cannot perceptibly alter the past of the universe that we perceive. They can, however, compress ages or extend moments to arbitrary durations, to uses limited only by the material supplies provided, and our own patience...

LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE
N-Dimensional Subspace

LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE_DESC
Early superstring theorists spoke of 10, 11 or 26 dimensional universes, with all but the 4 macrodimensions "curled up" so tightly as to be unseen. These and other dimensions may now be uncurled and opened, and the very surface of space itself stretched and pierced by shifting matter to or from levels of existence previously hidden below the surface of our limited perception, or creating layers or bubbles where none existed before.

LRN_UNIF_CONC
Unified Consciousness

LRN_UNIF_CONC_DESC
'''By transferring the mind into cyberspace, thousands of minds can act as one, their actions perfectly unified and directed towards the good of the whole.

Telepathic communication between individuals or mind-machine interfaces only permit the most basic, trivial and surface exchanges of thought and ideas. Truly joined minds function as a single consciousness, with the summed faculties and knowledge of its constituent parts, and acting as a new unique entity. This has great potential, but also significant risk, in that the union may not seek its own destruction, which is necessary for the original minds to be regained. Alternatively, one of the minds may dominate the other, controlling or destroying the other, rather than forming an equal, harmonious union.'''

Often, it is helpful to think of an ecosystem as a gigantic organism in and of itself, with predator-prey relationships acting as negative feedback loops, with newly introduced species acting as symbiotes or parasites, with populations acting as systems and individuals acting as cells. In this sense, every planet is alive, and as such, goes through various phases of "life".

'''Increases [[encyclopedia INDUSTRY_TITLE]] by +5 on all Industry-focused colonies in system with an asteroid belt outposts. Additional asteriod outposts do not provide additional benefit.

Mineral resource extraction from sub-planetoid-sized bodies involves challenges and provides opportunities quite distinct from those of full-fledged planets. Lacking sufficient mass to self-liquify and differentiate, asteroids can provide much easier access to some heavier elements, and lack of a gravity can make extraction for use in space much more efficient. Conversely, the limited size of each source asteroid requires fully portable self-sufficient extraction facilities. As well, the challenges of any microgravity environment must be overcome, requiring redesign of many traditional methods.

The microgravity of low planetary orbit offers great potential for novel manufacturing facility designs, equipment and techniques not possible on planet surfaces. Solids may be held in place with minimal support. Liquids and gases float freely, shaped only by surface tension, unless otherwise manipulated. Factory equipment may be arranged optimally in three dimensions. These conditions permit great increases in efficiency and productivity, if properly exploited.'''

Accessing these regions to extract the materials is difficult and treacherous, but eminently rewarding, compared to traditional surface mining activities.

Useful minerals are created throughout the volume of a planet, under various exacting chemical and thermodynamic conditions, including aqueous surface sedimentation, crushing core differentiation and mid-depth metamorphosis.

PRO_NANOTECH_PROD
Nanotech Production

PRO_NANOTECH_PROD_DESC
Traditional production techniques are fundamentally limited by the size and form of the tools they employ. As a product takes form, its outer layers may prevent direct access and manipulation of the inner structure, requiring inconvenient and inefficient adjustment to the order of assembly. Furthermore, the components of a larger product must be carefully formed and assembled to exacting specifications to ensure they will function as intended when combined. By using nanotechnology to form a complete product in one step, directly from the stock materials, these limitations can be bypassed, dramatically improving efficiency and production speed.

'''Once troublesome gravity well problems are overcome, gas giants offer a unique opportunity to harvest usable energy quickly and efficiently. Methods which take advantage of the high density atmosphere and belt-zone circulation allow a significant amount of energy to be easily accrued and transported for use in nearby planets.

Low orbit of planetary bodies provides numerous benefits for power generation compared to planetary surfaces. Direct exposure to nearby solar radiation without atmospheric attenuation, and the orders of magnitude larger structures that may be assembled in microgravity to collect it are significant advantages. The resulting power may be used in orbit, or may be beamed to the planet to support surface industry.

Traditional means of production are limited by the necessity of self-sufficiency due to transportation and other logistical problems. Later developments in planetary regional cooperation permit some degree of specialization and co-operation, with each facility producing only a few parts or subsystems, and the whole system benefitting from concentrated expertise and economy of scale. Expanding this concept several orders of magnitude, it may adapted to a galactic scale, with individual planets or entire systems functioning in the role of the single specialized facility. The logistical difficulties inherent in this paradigm are also similar to those of the earlier iteration, and are scaled up to the same degree as the potential benefits.

''' Unlocks Hyperspatial Dam

Once the greatest fear of N-dimensional physicists, now the noblest goal. To deliberately create a hyperspatial rift between our universe and the next, but inside a dimensional bubble, safely separate from known space-time. Once this is accomplished, it would be a relatively simple matter to tap into the enormous flow of energy that would travel across the rift.

The geometry of physical space has always been a major impediment to the assembly of objects within that space. Objects cannot be collocated, and volumes cannot be simultaneously enclosed and open if their existence is restricted to a mere three dimensions. Moving beyond this limitation, parts of objects can be folded out of the way in a pocket dimensions, and contiguous lines may be passed around other masses by going "off-axis". Similar mechanisms are also used to assemble lower-dimensional objects in configurations that would be impossible without higher-dimensional pathways.'''

PRO_SINGULAR_GEN
Singularity Generation

PRO_SINGULAR_GEN_DESC
'''Harnessing energy from a black hole is significantly more dangerous than harnessing energy from a regular star, but also has potential for significantly greater gains. By building a generator designed to tap into the energy of particle-antiparticle collisions on the event horizon of a singularity, tremendous benefits to industry may be obtained.

As matter is drawn towards a singularity by the intense space-time curvature, or gravitational field, the matter forms an accretion disk and is greatly compressed and heated. High energy radiation emitted from the disk may be captured and harnessed for power generation. The event horizon of the singularity itself also emits radiation due to the annihilation of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs that form in its vicinity. This method of power generation is significantly more delicate and unstable than the accretion disk method, but can produce an even greater output.'''

PRO_ZERO_GEN
Zero-Point Generation

PRO_ZERO_GEN_DESC
'''Any power generation mechanism that involves a material fuel supply is limited by the relativistic mass-energy relationship: no more energy can be produced than equivalent mass consumed, even with perfect efficiency. By tapping the inherent energy of the vacuum, or zero-point energy, an effectively infinite source is made available. The rate, or power, of this extraction is also theoretically unbounded, with limits only in the available means to collect and use the output.

At appropriate scales and under specific conditions, matter-energy becomes a unified phenomenon. Applied at larger scales, complete control over the structure of matter and the dynamics of energy becomes possible, as does the interchange between the two. Transmutation and replication, at limited scales, become possible.  However, despite the enormous rest mass energy equivalence of matter, converting directly to energy for bulk power generation is generally less effective than comparatively simple fusion generation.

Previous production techniques were essentially ways to avoid or remove particularly vexing problems with manipulation of matter. None of these techniques fundamentally changed the basic method however, which was to assemble larger objects out of supplied materials, be they prefabricated subsections, or raw minerals. By converting pure energy directly into the desired material object, the need for supplied materials such as minerals or food can become greatly reduced in times of necessity.'''

Infrastructure Ecology

CON_INFRA_ECOL_DESC
The basic infrastructure of an established planetary colony may seem to be created entirely by the colonizers, and to function only according to their designs. In reality, however, the ecology of the planet on which it is built is the foundation and support mechanism for the added infrastructure, and often forms an integral part of its function. Understanding the interaction between natural and artificial components, and the limits of the resources an ecological system can provide are essential to the development of an optimal and sustainable infrastructure for any colony.

CON_ORGANIC_STRC

'''Buildings formed of inanimate minerals are functional and occasionally elegant, and those of harvested but dead organics are often simple and inexpensive. Actual living structures, however, can be grown into their final shape with no additional labour, as well effect some degree of self-repair when damaged. They may also naturally self-regulate their internal environments, or potentially adapt to varied or changing surroundings as necessary, during or after their initial growth.

A shutter functions as both a solid wall and open window, according to the desire of its user. A room may be refurnished to serve an entirely new purpose, within the limits of the space available. This concept may also be extended to the actual form and structure of an entire building or city, whether mechanical or organic. Eliminating the need for demolition and rebuilding permits much greater infrastructure flexibility and efficiency. Single or isolated structures may also serve many purposes simultaneously, that would previously have required much larger and elaborate fixed designs.'''

Metroplex Infrastructure

CON_METRO_INFRA_DESC
When the entire surface of a world is covered, continued development must occur above and below pre-existing construction.  Care must be taken to ensure the stability of the undercut or overshadowed structures are not damaged, and transportation and supply routes must be rethought to support vastly increased population densities. Furthermore, novel stylistic and functional issues must be considered, to ensure that the newer levels, and the combined whole, are worth inhabiting.

CON_ARCH_MONOFILS
Architectural Monofilaments

CON_ARCH_MONOFILS_DESC
Essentially unbreakable and merely a few atoms in diameter, single-crystal filaments have many uses in improving traditional structure designs in durability and economy of construction. The capacity to suspend or stress other materials in previously impossible configurations also permits a wholly new designs. Low weight and high strength filaments are of particular use in large-scale orbital or surface to orbit spanning structures, where variations in gravity across lengths were previously very prohibitive.

CON_ASYMP_MATS
Asymptotic Materials

CON_ASYMP_MATS_DESC
Once certain thresholds of performance are passed, measuring the physical properties of materials for relative comparison becomes impractical in any terms other than orders of magnitude or logarithmic scales. Much like superconductivity in electronics, the tensile strength, toughness, density, elasticity, refractory index and other mechanical properties of materials may be controlled with effectively no limits. With all previously significant limitations removed, structure designs are further unhindered, and may extend or change by similar order of magnitude scales.

SHP_MIL_ROBO_CONT
Military Robotic Control

SHP_MIL_ROBO_CONT_DESC
Robotic control can be used effectively for tasks such as mining and industry; the natural extension of this concept is to develop military robotic equipment capable of independently operating a starship.

Hulls produced with such technology could also perform dangerous repairs without thought for the safety and biological limitations of living engineers.

SHP_SPACE_FLUX_DRIVE
Spatial Flux Drive

SHP_SPACE_FLUX_DRIVE_DESC
Ordinarily, propulsion in space is limited to either propellant or field propulsion. On relatively small scales however, it is possible to propel an object in space much like one could in water: by pushing backwards the medium in which the object is immersed. This requires the manipulation of space itself whereby the smallest units of space are collapsed, forcing the matter they once contained into adjacent units of space. This method of propulsion is very efficient, but dangerous on larger scales and easily detectable due to the dimensional effects.

SHP_CONTGRAV_MAINT
Contra-Gravitational Maintenance

SHP_CONTGRAV_MAINT_DESC
When the mass of the ship surpasses a certain threshold, it becomes necessary to consider the gravitational stresses on vital architectural points in the ship's structure. These points will be unable to withstand the gravitational stresses and collapse, destroying the vessel. This necessitates nearly constant maintenance of these points to avoid total structural failure.

SHP_NANOROBO_MAINT
Nano-Robotic Maintenance

SHP_NANOROBO_MAINT_DESC
Just as nanorobots can be used for production, so also can they be used for maintenance. A hull with a complement of centrally organized nanite engineers would be able to rapidly repair damage, even during combat. Such machines would have great difficulty distinguishing organic beings from a part of the hull in need of repair however, and as such this concept could only be applied to automated hulls.

SHP_MASSPROP_SPEC
Mass-Propulsion Specialization

SHP_MASSPROP_SPEC_DESC
Traditional propulsion devices operate well on objects of relatively low mass. However, when the mass of a ship approaches that of a small moon, ordinary methods of propulsion are very clumsy and require tremendous amounts of energy. A new approach to propulsion, taking into account the size of the object in question as a fundamental aspect of the system, could allow such vessels to have useful mobility.

SHP_TRANSSPACE_DRIVE

SHP_TRANSSPACE_DRIVE_DESC
Even when spatial dimensions are skewed by relativistic effects, an object generally has constant space-time characteristics. By creating a device which alters the characteristics of space-time itself using quasi-relativistic effects, it would be possible to create a fast, stealthy method of propulsion. 

SHP_MIDCOMB_LOG
Mid-Combat Logistics

SHP_MIDCOMB_LOG_DESC
When interstellar fleets are in regular, commonplace use, the transfer of personnel and materiel in the absence of enemy ships is a relatively trivial task. In combat however, when such transfers could potentially have great tactical merit, there is great difficulty with the coordinational aspects of logistics due to the possibility of sudden changes in the tactical scenario. By using a single mobile command station, it is possible to organize and enact logistic patterns in the midst of combat.

SHP_ASTEROID_HULLS
Asteroid Hulls

SHP_ASTEROID_HULLS_DESC
Rather than constructing a hull from scratch, it is far easier to take a pre-existing space-borne object and adapt it to fill the role of a ship's hull. Not only would such ships be very inexpensive to produce, but they would also be able to avoid detection by enemy ships by hiding amongst other asteroids.

While modifying asteroids to serve as ship's hulls is very efficient, it is limited by the available sizes and shapes of available asteroids. By combining or breaking apart asteroids, asteroid hulls of extremely large or small sizes could be produced.'''

SHP_MONOMOLEC_LATTICE
Monomolecular Latticing

SHP_MONOMOLEC_LATTICE_DESC
Asteroid Hulls can be reinforced and armor plated, but the fact remains that the basic substance of which most asteroids are primarily composed is of lesser strength than most modern alloys. However, if the molecular structure of the rock itself were to be rearranged into a crystal lattice, its strength could be increased tremendously, allowing the production of asteroid hulls of previously impossible strengths.

SHP_MULTICELL_CAST
Multi-Cellular Casting

SHP_MULTICELL_CAST_DESC
Even when it is inert, organic material is much more versatile than standard materials. A non-living multi-cellular ship would provide some of the advantages of organic materials without the customary nuisances of organic life.

SHP_DOMESTIC_MONSTER
Domesticated Mega-Fauna

SHP_DOMESTIC_MONSTER_DESC
'''Though huge and alien the time-tested arts of domestication can also be applied to the space monsters that travel the starlanes. Building Colonies or Outposts at monster nests will enable the raising of domesticated monsters.'''

SHP_ENDOCRINE_SYSTEMS
Mega-Fauna Endocrine Systems

SHP_ENDOCRINE_SYSTEMS_DESC
The study of space-faring organisms' endocrine systems allows for the expansion of organic ships' internal structures.  

SHP_HAB_MEGAFAUN
Habitable Mega-Fauna

SHP_HAB_MEGAFAUN_DESC
It is generally uncommon to find comfortable living conditions within a gigantic space monster. This is exactly what must exist within an organic hull however, if it is to be adequately controlled from within. The development of massive, habitable creatures opens up numerous possibilities for ship design.

SHP_MONOCELL_EXP
Mono-Cellular Expansion

SHP_MONOCELL_EXP_DESC
Multi-cellular organisms tend to have longer life spans than single celled organisms due to specialization and interdependency. However, with the appropriate technological refinements, these aspects of multi-cellular life can be applied to a massive mono-cellular organism, allowing it to have practical functionality in combat.

SHP_CONT_SYMB
Contrived Symbiosis

SHP_CONT_SYMB_DESC
Any ship's hull is in a symbiotic relationship with its makers in that they bring it into being and sustain it, and it performs its desired functions. However, this is a purely behavioral type of symbiosis. Through careful planning and design, an organic ship can be made to have a biological symbiotic relationship with its crew, each providing the other with the essentials of life.

SHP_CONT_BIOADAPT
Controlled Ravenous Bioadaption

SHP_CONT_BIOADAPT_DESC
It is very difficult to predict the actions of a living being to any useful degree of certainty without having an intimate understanding of its behavioral patterns. By placing a life form under harshly competitive developmental conditions, its behavioral patterns can be manipulated, strengthened and effectively utilized in war.

SHP_BIOADAPTIVE_SPEC
Bio-Neural Specialization

SHP_BIOADAPTIVE_SPEC_DESC
As a species evolves mental capabilities, the individuals whose minds are not perfectly attuned to the needs of their bodies cannot compete with those whose minds are perfectly specialized for their bodies. Thus, all evolved life forms have nearly ideal mental development for their type of body. There are no such guarantees for artificial life forms however, and often the true potential of such a being is unrealized due to subtle incompatibilities between mind and body. By specializing the organism's neural patterns to conform to its body type, these incompatibilities can be eliminated.

SHP_FRC_ENRG_COMP
Force-Energy Compression

SHP_FRC_ENRG_COMP_DESC
Typically, the manipulation of energy requires it to be in the form of matter so that potential energy can be stored as desired and released on demand. Matter converted to pure energy stored in the fabric of space-time itself would be more versatile than any material substance, but impossible to contain without advanced force-field technology.

SHP_QUANT_ENRG_MAG
Quantum Energy Magnification

SHP_QUANT_ENRG_MAG_DESC
'''This hull magnifies quantum energy fluctuations to increase its own power. It has seven external slots and three internal slots. Speed and structure are very high, but [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] is very low. This hull requires a very great deal of energy to construct and can only be build at a system with a star of type Blue or Black Hole.

Due to quantum uncertainty, it is possible for a particle to arbitrarily gain a small amount of energy or for new particles to temporarily enter existence. By detecting and magnifying these fluctuations in quantum energy, it would be possible to tremendously increase the capabilities of an energy hull.'''

SHP_ENRG_BOUND_MAN
Energy Boundary Manipulation

SHP_ENRG_BOUND_MAN_DESC
'''Whether constructed, grown, or adapted from a pre-existing structure, ships composed of matter must have a logical and co-ordinated structure to allow even basic utility. Pure energy however, has no such restrictions. This allows a pure energy hull to take on any form whatsoever, however impractical it would be from a material standpoint.

This hull, while small, has a fractal surface which allows many more parts to be mounted than would be possible on a smoother hull. It has twenty-seven external slots, but no internal slots. [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] is very low, but structure and speed are average. This hull requires a very great deal of energy to construct and can only be built at a system with a star of type Blue or Black Hole.'''
SHP_SOLAR_CONT
Solar Containment

SHP_SOLAR_CONT_DESC
'''A hull constructed from pure energy, while far more versatile than a solid hull, has a disadvantage in that it is unable to harness the potential energy of material objects. If, however, it were made possible to contain a hull composed not of pure energy, but of super-heated gases constantly undergoing a self-sustaining fusion reaction, the limitations of both pure energy and solid matter could be avoided.

This mighty flagship is essentially a miniature sun, and as such is a great source of both fuel and visibility. All accompanying friendly ships completely recover fuel between combat, and all enemy ships in the vicinity receive a penalty to [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]]. This hull has eighteen external slots and nine internal slots - a far greater internal capacity than any other hull. Structure is extremely high, but speed and [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] are very low. However, this ship has the ability to enter a star and hide, giving it perfect [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] on the galaxy map when it is in a system with a star of type other than Black Hole or Neutron, and in combat, when it is hiding inside such a star. This ship requires a tremendous amount of energy to construct and must harness energy from particle-antiparticle collisions on the event horizon of a Black Hole in its formation.'''

Orbital Construction

CON_ORBITAL_CON_DESC
'''Increases the [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] line range of all colonies by 1.

On a planet, there is always a fixed reference direction: "up". Microgravity is effectively isotropic. This single difference has a multitude of consequences for the types of structures that can be built, and which of those forms is the optimal use of space, materials and energy in each environment. As well, the interior configuration of spaces in orbit must be rethought. However, while it is appealing to attempt to completely revolutionize interior design in a paradigm completely independent of the styles used on planet surfaces, the practical use of these spaces will be initial primarily by those who are used to, and adapted for, those planet surfaces. Rather than a complete break from older styles, a gradual transition may be more effective.'''

'''Increases [[encyclopedia INFRASTRUCTURE_TITLE]] by 10.  Cannot improve a planet with the [[special TUNNELS_SPECIAL]] or [[special TECTONIC_INSTABILITY_SPECIAL]] special.

When space is at a premium, the ability to build downwards as well as up is an invaluable asset. Entire underground cities and facilities can be constructed and maintained, and trans-planetary subterranean transportation routes can be established.'''

CON_CONC_CAMP
Concentration Camps

CON_CONC_CAMP_DESC
Typically, when forced to work to death, citizens will put up some resistance and have the sympathy and support of outside observers. However, by carefully creating buildings designed to quench the fire of justice within outsiders, and to promote feelings of worthlessness and subservience in those on the inside, concentration camps can be effectively utilized without fear of revolt.

CON_FRC_ENRG_CAMO
Force-Energy Camouflage

CON_FRC_ENRG_CAMO_DESC
'''Increases the [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] of all buildings by 50.

Ordinary physical structures tend to be both opaque and rigid, being constructed from similarly opaque and rigid natural materials. A force field does not, of necessity, possess these features in any permanent sense, and can be turned on and off or changed from one color to another at will. While most buildings are easily visible from many uus away with a powerful detection apparatus, a force-energy structure - or a regular structure surrounded by a series of camouflage force-fields - would be essentially invisible from great distances.'''

CON_PLANET_DRIVE
Planetary Starlane Drive

CON_PLANET_DRIVE_DESC
Planets in the outermost systems of an empire are often in great danger of attack from enemy fleets, yet these planets can often contain extremely valuable resources and specials. By equipping an entire planet with the means to open and navigate a starlane, it would be possible to move such planets to a safer location in times of necessity.

CON_STARGATE
Stargate

CON_STARGATE_DESC
Particularly in more expansive empires, the need to move ships to a specific defensive location in great haste often exceeds the feasibility. By creating a warp between two or more points in space-time, it can be made possible to move ships even across an entire empire at need, allowing new offensive and defensive strategies.

CON_ART_PLANET
Artificial Planet

CON_ART_PLANET_DESC
Gas giants and asteroid belts offer unique opportunities and resources, not only as sites for acquiring valuable - and on occasion extremely rare - resources, but as raw materials in and of themselves for the production of artificial planets. Such planets would offer new centres for production in previously empty or entirely occupied systems. In addition, various key features of the planet can be modified or added during the construction process, potentially allowing the planets size and environment to be specified, or certain planet specials to be added.

GRO_INDUSTRY_FARM
Industrial Farming

GRO_INDUSTRY_FARM_DESC
Traditional, simple farming methods are sufficient for small, locally self-sufficient populations without significant limits on available space or time. With greater specialization of more advanced societies however, fewer farmers must feed many more workers from much greater distances away, including even interstellar food shipment for fledgling colonies or major industrial centres. This dependency on interstellar shipping routes makes industrial worlds extremely vulnerable to blockade by enemy forces. By gradually adapting factories and adding supplementary infrastructure over a long period of time, waste matter and energy can be used to grow food with no extra cost, allowing industrial planets a small supply of food in great need.

GRO_GENOME_BANK
Genome Bank

GRO_GENOME_BANK_DESC
The unknown variables in genomic calculations for any given species remain severe for all but the simplest genetic repairs, not to mention the changes that a genetic modification can potentially have on a larger multi-species biosphere. To truly realize the benefits of genetic medicine, it is necessary to collect a massive genome database for all the species from all known worlds.

GRO_INDUSTRY_CLONE
Industrial Cloning

GRO_INDUSTRY_CLONE_DESC
Primitive manual nuclear transfer cloning techniques are little more than novelties for large organisms. By applying techniques similar to industrial mass production or biochemical process engineering, it becomes possible to generate dozens, or millions, of full-grown copies of a single genetic blueprint. Populations may be made to order, tailored to meet the specific needs of society.

GRO_ORBIT_FARMING
Orbital Farming

GRO_ORBIT_FARMING_DESC
'''Increases target Farming on all planets by 2, regardless of focus and environment.

The primary energy source for food production in most societies is solar radiation. Bound to a planet, farms have very limited access to this energy, due to the comparatively small solid angle subtended by the planet's surface and other land uses competing with surface farming. By moving food production to orbital installations, continuous access to solar energy is gained, and any undesired spectral filtration by planetary atmospheres is eliminated.'''

GRO_TERRAFORM
Terraforming

GRO_TERRAFORM_DESC
Changing the environmental type of a planet is a massive undertaking, the challenge of this process is to a large degree logistical. The precise method depends greatly on the type of planet to be changed and the desired result. However, in all cases much of the surface of the entire planet and its atmosphere needs to be converted to other types of molecules, vented into space or buried under the crust. As such, this process requires most of the planet to be accessible to the terraformers, and cannot be performed on a world with max population less than one.

GRO_TERRAFORM_SHORT_DESC
Allows terraforming

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM
Remote Terraforming

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM_DESC
Traditional terraforming methods treat the planet as a structure and attempt to alter its environment through physical and chemical means. This necessitates that the majority of the planet be accessible to the terraforming species, which generally limits its usefulness. By treating the planet as an organism and altering its physiology indirectly, it is possible to make use of less labour intensive, though more time consuming terraforming methods, allowing outposts on poor and hostile worlds to make use of terraforming.

GRO_BIOTERROR
Bioterror Facilites

GRO_BIOTERROR_DESC
A research centre created to safely develop the most dangerous of biological weaponry while keeping prying eyes out. Biological weaponry takes effect too slowly to be of much use in a direct military conflict, but as a weapon of terror it is unsurpassed; a slowly growing contamination will spread panic before it, images of a desperate people quarantined by their own government sowing despair beyond the affected area. However, care must be taken when developing such organisms to ensure they are not accidentally released. Furthermore, utter secrecy is required to dispel the risk of damaging relations with civilians and other empires.

GRO_GAIA_TRANS
Gaia Transformation

GRO_GAIA_TRANS_DESC
Theoretically, it is possible to completely predict the ecology of a single planet by mapping out its entire web of biological interdependence, both sentient and non-sentient, in fractal algorithms. In practice however, this could only be realized by constructing a vast planet-spanning network running a computer program dedicated to regulating the planet's entire biosphere. This computer would become, in effect, the brain of a new type of life - a single planetary organism, with intelligent citizens as part of its fabric, subject to the greater will.

GRO_GAIA_TRANS_SHORT_DESC
Allows Gaia Transformation

LRN_OBSERVATORY_I
Observatory

LRN_OBSERVATORY_I_DESC
Studying and understanding the nature of stars and their internal and external attributes provides powerful insight into the nature of stellar phenomena and planetary bodies. Furthermore, fractal algorithms can be employed to decipher the dispersal of starlanes throughout the galaxy, allowing any stars which are in some way connected, however indirectly, to the known network of starlanes to be identified an monitored.

LRN_SOLAR_MAN
Solar Manipulation

LRN_SOLAR_MAN_DESC
Different star types not only have their own distinct attributes and opportunities for exploitation, but also tend to give rise to a particular planet type. Often, a star of a particular type will give a desired bonus, but will almost certainly be devoid of any desirable planets, or will not be present in an opportune location in the galaxy. By manipulating the high-energy reactions within a star's core, it would be possible to either reverse or accelerate the natural processes within the star, allowing it to be changed to an entirely different type at need.

A network of specialized satellites can use tomographic methods to reconstruct the activities occurring deep within a star. These otherwise costly-to-produce conditions are ideal for a variety of research endeavors, with larger benefits for more exotic star types.'''

LRN_SPATIAL_DISTORT_GEN
Spatial Distortion Generator

LRN_SPATIAL_DISTORT_GEN_DESC
'''By manipulating the dimensional properties of a starlane, it would be possible to selectively bend it so that an incoming ship of sufficiently low speed would inadvertently arrive back where it began, having wasted its time and fuel.

LRN_GATEWAY_VOID
Gateway to the Void

LRN_GATEWAY_VOID_DESC
The power of the Void Mind is almost imperceptible in a mere four-dimensional space-time. By creating a permanent gateway accessing an immense number of dimensions, a dangerous, non-discriminating force can be unleashed in a localized area.

LRN_ENCLAVE_VOID
Enclave of the Void

LRN_ENCLAVE_VOID_DESC
Study of the Void Mind could be accelerated by genetically engineering the populace of an entire world to be attuned to the Void. This new priestly class could transform the entire social structure of their world to better understand and channel the wisdom of the Void Mind to the entire empire.

LRN_ART_BLACK_HOLE

LRN_PSY_DOM_DESC
'''Has a 10% chance of taking control of any enemy ship within one starlane jump of a colony owned by the empire, provided that the ship is not owned by an empire who also has this tech.

It is difficult to force a conscious individual to submit to the total mental control of another entity against its will. By manipulating the timeframes involved however, the mental force exerted by a population over a period of hours may be brought to bear on a single individual in the span of a few seconds, creating an almost irresistible compulsion to join the unified mind.'''

LRN_RUINS_MOD

PRO_HEAVY_MINING_I
Heavy Mining Processors

PRO_HEAVY_MINING_I_DESC
When increased minerals production is the only concern, no environmental damage considerations exist and the environment itself is conducive, partially automated bulk mining activities can be optimal. Heavy mining processors are expensive however, and are only practical to use on worlds with primary focus mining. As well, these processors severely damage the ecology of a planet, reducing its maximum population somewhat.

PRO_SOL_ORB_GEN
Solar Orbital Generation

SH_SOLAR
Solar Hull

SH_SOLAR_DESC
'''This mighty flagship is essentially a miniature sun, and as such is a great source of both fuel and visibility. All accompanying friendly ships completely recover fuel between combat, and all enemy ships in the vicinity receive a penalty to [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]]. This hull has eighteen external slots and nine internal slots - a far greater internal capacity than any other hull. Structure is extremely high, but speed and [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] are very low. However, this ship has the ability to enter a star and hide, giving it perfect [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] on the galaxy map when it is in a system with a star of type other than Black Hole or Neutron, and in combat, when it is hiding inside such a star. This ship requires a tremendous amount of energy to construct and must harness energy from particle-antiparticle collisions on the event horizon of a Black Hole in its formation.

Requires a Basic Shipyard, an Energy Compressor and a Solar Containment Unit at the planet where it is built.'''
